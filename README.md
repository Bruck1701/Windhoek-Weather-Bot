# Windhoek-Weather-Bot
#### Python Bot that tweets the temperature, humidity , and Information about Visible Light and Infra red captured by sensors on an Arduino Uno board. 

<br>
This is a project for a Python bot that gathers raw data from an Arduino Board and stores it and publishes it on Twitter (<a href=https://twitter.com/BotWindhoek> @BotWindhoek </a>)
<br>

The data to be stored will be put initially on a CSV file. The file is to be used to train a temperature prediction model based on LSTM so the bot will make his predictions based on the trained model (to be done).

The Twitter API is being used to publish the captured data. In order to break the monotony of the sensors' raw data, jokes, random quotes and other info or pictures are to be randomly selected to be included on the tweets.

The Twitter interface will also be used to control the bot remotely (to be done)
